            Social media has had a large impact on many subcultures, creating an echo chamber for people, for both good and bad. Here, we focus on how social media 
            has exacerbated subcultures that promote negative ideologies, including incel forums, TERFs, and neo-nazism. We examine the three subcultures in depth, including their origins and how it evolved
            into what it has due to social media.
